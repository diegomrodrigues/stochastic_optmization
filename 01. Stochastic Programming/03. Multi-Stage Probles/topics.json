        "Probabilistic constraints are introduced, where the probability of satisfying a set of inequalities is greater than or equal to a certain level, leading to the concepts of joint and individual probabilistic constraints.",
        "Stochastic dominance relations are defined, where a random variable X dominates another random variable Y in a certain order if their distribution functions satisfy specific inequalities.",
        "Generalized concavity of functions and measures is explored, defining \u03b1-concave functions and their properties, such as log-concavity and quasi-concavity.",
        "Concavity properties of probability measures are examined, focusing on \u03b1-concave measures and their relationship to the density function.",
        "Convexity of probabilistically constrained sets is analyzed, providing conditions under which the feasible set defined by probabilistic constraints is convex and closed.",
        "Dualization of nonanticipativity constraints is discussed, formulating the Lagrangian and dual problem, and deriving necessary conditions of optimality and duality relations."
