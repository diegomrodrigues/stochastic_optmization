        "Stochastic programming addresses optimization problems where the objective function involves random variables. It aims to optimize the expected value of a random outcome, modeled by a function F(x, w), where x is the decision variable and w is the random event. The stochastic optimization model minimizes the expected value function f(x) := E[F(x, w)] over a feasible set X, effectively optimizing the random outcome F(x, w) on average. This approach is justified when the Law of Large Numbers applies and the focus is on long-term performance, disregarding short-term fluctuations.",
        "Deterministic optimization assumes known parameters, whereas stochastic programming explicitly models uncertainty. This provides solutions robust against variability and applicable when decisions must account for a range of possible scenarios. A deterministic approach to optimization may lead to unreasonable solutions when applied to stochastic problems, as it ignores the risk associated with the variability of outcomes, potentially leading to significant losses in specific realizations.",
        "Stochastic programming is particularly useful in real-world scenarios such as portfolio selection, where decisions must balance expected return with risk, and in supply chain management, where demand and supply uncertainties need to be considered.",
        "Risk-averse stochastic optimization considers the expected values of scalar transformations u of the outcomes, where the choice of u reflects preferences. In a minimization context, a random outcome Z\u2081 is preferred over Z\u2082 if E[u(Z\u2081)] < E[u(Z\u2082)]."
